## Prompt
Write a method that returns true or false that can determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string s1 to another s2.
For example, given s1 = abg and s2 = bcd, return true since we can map a to b, b to c, and g to d.
Given s1 = foo and s2 = bar, return false since the o cannot map to two different characters.

Please Note that your solution will be judged based on the following criteria: 
Does the solution address the given problem correctly. (Code Correct)

How efficient is the code?
